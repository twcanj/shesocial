## Vite Cache Management

### Normal Development (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev  # Uses Vite's optimized caching for best performance
```

### Cache Troubleshooting (When Needed)
```bash
# Force fresh dependency optimization
npm run dev:fresh

# Manual cache clearing
npm run clear-cache

# Hard browser refresh
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Understanding Vite Behavior
- **Module Duplication in Sources Tab**: Normal - shows both source files and transformed modules
